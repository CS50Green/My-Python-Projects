# Drink Water Reminder
## Description:

Assalamualaikum World!

This is my Python project. I created this project to remind me to drink water.

## How to use this applications
It is very, very simple to use we just need **Python** to run it, obviously!!!!.

Since this is a reminder app it should run in the background. To run an application in the background, we will need a tool that will automatically run the application in the background.

For now, I only know about two tools that will run an application automatically in the background. In windows, we can use **Task Scheduler** and in macOS or linux we can use **cronjob**.
